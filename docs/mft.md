MFT tokens are integrated in Mainframe OS to power underlying services. In this initial release, users can stake MFT to send invitations to other users to connect.

Coming soon, developers can stake MFT to submit their dapps to be included in the Mainframe App Store. We are also exploring subscription models for app users and developers, facilitating in-app purchases or upgrades, and tiered/paid dapps, all powered by MFT.

Mainframe is particularly interested in and currently exploring an MFT powered decentralized gas relayer network (see EIP-1077). This dramatically simplifies the user on-boarding experience and opens more clearly defined monetization opportunities for dapp developers. Imagine using a dapp for the first time and not needing to acquire ETH.

As additional underlying services are enhanced to include incentivization functionality, MFT will be integrated more and more to power those services and create a seamless experience for users. Mainframe continues to be dedicated to a frictionless experience for users of our platform.
