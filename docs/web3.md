Web3 recently made a breaking change where it rejects the use of custom providers, which affected us as we use a custom provider in Mainframe OS. There has been a bit of backlash from Truffle and Embark and looks like will be rolling back, but still means we canâ€™t use Web3 1.0.0-beta-38 - 41 in any of our apps with our current provider setup.
